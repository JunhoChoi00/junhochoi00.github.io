  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Economics (double major). I’m interested in AI applications in biomedical data, particularly using deep learning and statistical tools to analyze cfDNA methylation for cancer detection, and in digital health applications for underserved populations.
